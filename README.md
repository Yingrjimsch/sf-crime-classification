### Introduction
During twelve weeks, we were shown the basic tools of machine learning in the Machine Learning and
Data Mining module. In numerous practical courses, we were able to get to know the individual
"tools" using fictitious examples and also try them out. Now we get the chance to prove our skills
on real data.


### Data - Analysis
* **Dates** &#10132;  timestamp of the crime incident
* **Category** &#10132; Category of the incident (only in the training data). Variable to predict.
* **Descript** &#10132; a description of the incident (only in the training data)
* **DayOfWeek** &#10132; the day of the week
* **PdDistrict** &#10132; name of the Police Department Disctrict
* **Resolution** &#10132; how the incident was resolved (only in the training data)
* **Address** &#10132; approximate street address of the incident
* **X** &#10132; geographical longitude
* **Y** &#10132; geographical latitude
